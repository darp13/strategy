In the class I learned more about programming. At first I was a little bit scared because I really didn´t know how to code. But when the class pass I was understanding more and more about this coding world, I learned about linear programming, also I put my new abilities into work with the mini cases so that was fun and also refreshing. I´m thankfull for the class and the work.
